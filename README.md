# Uber-Price-Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the prices of Uber rides based on various features such as distance, time, traffic conditions, and more. The model is trained and evaluated using historical Uber trip data, and multiple regression algorithms are implemented and compared to find the best-performing model.
